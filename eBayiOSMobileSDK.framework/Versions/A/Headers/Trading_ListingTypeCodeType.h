             Formerly, this was a fixed-price format for eBay Store sellers.
             <br><br>
             As of March 30, 2010, the FixedPriceItem listing type has replaced the
             StoresFixedPrice listing type on all eBay sites.
             The StoresFixedPrice listing type will be deprecated in early 2011.
             Currently, AddItem
             and AddFixedPriceItem accept either FixedPriceItem or StoresFixedPrice as listing
             types, but the item is displayed as FixedPriceItem on the site and in search
             results. GetItem and other 'Get' calls will return the listing type you originally
             used in the request. Therefore, the preferred format is FixedPriceItem.
             <br><br>
 In additon to the changes mentioned above, items added as StoresFixedPrice listing
 type are treated as FixedPriceItem listing type on the site. Items will immediately
 get the higher FixedPriceItem exposure, and will renew or relist at the FixedPriceItem
 price.
             <br><br>
 Any listing enhancements (e.g., bold, subtitle, etc.) will also renew or relist at
 FixedPriceItem (higher) rates.
             <br><br>
             To list a product for a store, you can simply substitute FixedPriceItem as the listing
             type where the StoresFixedPrice listing type used to be within your AddItem call. Like
             StoresFixedPrice, the FixedPriceItem listing type has permitted durations of 30 days
             and GTC for store and non-store subscribers (in addition to the previously permitted
             durations of 3, 5, 7, and 10 days).

 Second chance offer made to a non-winning bidder on an ended listing.
 A seller can make an offer to a non-winning bidder when either the winning bidder
 has failed to pay for an item or the seller has a duplicate of the item.
 A seller can create a Second Chance Offer immediately after a listing ends and up to
 60 days after the end of the listing. eBay does not charge an Insertion Fee,
 but if the bidder accepts the offer, the regular Final Value Fee is charged.
 In the case of an Unpaid Item, the seller should ensure that everything has
 been done to resolve the issue with the winning bidder before sending a
 Second Chance Offer to another bidder. See the Unpaid Items Process for details.
 Make sure you're aware of other rules and restrictions surrounding Second Chance Offers.
 Use AddSecondChanceItem to submit Second Chance Offers.
