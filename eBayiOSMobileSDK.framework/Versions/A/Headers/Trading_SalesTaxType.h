 GetItemTransactions can return incorrect sales tax if the name of a state is not
 abbreviated (e.g. if the value is "Illinois" rather than "IL") in
 TransactionArray.Transaction.Buyer.BuyerInfo.ShippingAddress.StateOrProvince. If
 the name of a state is not abbreviated, sales tax should be obtained by using
 the ItemID and TransactionID to call GetOrderTransactions.
