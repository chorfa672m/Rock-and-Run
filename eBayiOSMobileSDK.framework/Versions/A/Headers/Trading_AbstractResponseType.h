 This value represents the date and time when eBay processed the
 request. The time zone of this value is GMT and the format is the
 ISO 8601 date and time format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ). See Time
 Values in the eBay Web Services guide for information about this
 time format and converting to and from the GMT time zone. <br>

 GetCategories, GetAttributesCS, GetCategory2CS, GetAttributesXSL,
 GetProductFinder, GetProductFinderXSL, and GetProductSearchPage
 are designed to retrieve very large sets of metadata
 that change once a day or less often. To improve performance,
 these calls return cached responses when you request all available data
 (with no filters). When this occurs, this time value reflects the
 time the cached response was created. Thus, this value is not
 necessarily when the request was processed.
 However, if you specify an input filter to reduce the amount of data
 returned, the calls retrieve the latest data (not cached).
 When this occurs, this time value does reflect when the request
 was processed.</span>

 In most cases, all calls support a MessageID element in the request
 and a CorrelationID element in the response. If you pass a message
 ID in a request, we will return the same value in CorrelationID in
 the response. You can use this for tracking that a response is
 returned for every request and to match particular responses to
 particular requests. If you do not pass MessageID in the request,
 CorrelationID is not returned.<br>

/**
 
 Supplemental information from eBay, if applicable. May elaborate on 
 errors (such as how a listing violates eBay policies) or provide 
 useful hints that may help a seller increase sales. This data can 
 accompany the call's normal data result set or a result set that 
 contains only errors. <br>

 Applications must recognize when the Message field is returned and 
 provide a means to display the listing hints and error message 
 explanations to the user. <br>

 The string can return HTML, including TABLE, IMG, and HREF elements. 
 In this case, an HTML-based application should be able to include 
 the HTML as-is in the HTML page that displays the results. 
 A non-HTML application would need to parse the HTML
 and convert the table elements and image references into UI elements
 particular to the programming language used. 
 As usual for string data types, the HTML markup elements are escaped 
 with character entity references 
 (e.g.,&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;...).

 Expiration date of the user's authentication token. Only returned
