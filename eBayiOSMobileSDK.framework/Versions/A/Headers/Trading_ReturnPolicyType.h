 receive the item before processing the refund, and other useful details.).<br>

 return policy as unspecified. In a future release, the View Item page
 will be updated to indicate that returns are not accepted instead.)<br>

 All sites support the ability for a seller to not accept returns.
 If the seller doesn't accept returns, the item must specifically
 indicate ReturnsNotAccepted. (The return policy cannot be omitted
 from the item.)<br>
 <br>
 On the eBay UK and Ireland sites, business sellers must accept
 returns for fixed price items (including auction items with
 Buy It Now, and any other fixed price formats) when the category
 requires a return policy.
 On some European sites (such as eBay Germany (DE)), registered
 business sellers are required to accept returns.
