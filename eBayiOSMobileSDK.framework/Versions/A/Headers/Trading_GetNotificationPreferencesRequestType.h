 Retrieves the requesting application's notification preferences.
 Details are only returned for events for which a preference was
 set at one point. For example, if you enabled notification for
 the EndOfAuction event and later disabled it, the GetNotificationPreferences
 response would cite the EndOfAuction event preference as
 Disabled. Otherwise, no details would be returned regarding EndOfAuction.
