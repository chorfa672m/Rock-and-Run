/**
 
 Indicates whether listing images are included in the search
 results (in both Picture Gallery and List Views) and, if so,
 which image listing enhancements apply to them. Items that
 have pictures but do not have image listing enhancements
 display a generic photo image in search results.
 <br><br>
 If the value is Gallery, Plus, or Featured, eBay checks the
 available image URLs in the following order to determine
 which URL to use (if more than one of these URLs is
 available):<br>
 <br>
 a) Use the URL in GalleryURL, if it is specified.<br>
 b) Otherwise, if ProductListingDetails.UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery
 is true, use the eBay stock photo.<br>
 c) Otherwise, use the value of the first PictureURL in the
 array of PictureURL fields, if any.<br>
 d) Otherwise, if ProductListingDetails.ProductID is
 specified, use the eBay stock photo for that ProductID
 (eBay resets UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery to true in this
 case).<br>
 e) If eBay is unable to find an image URL for the listing,
 an error is returned.
 <br><br>
 Note that you can use the Gallery Plus feature
 whether or not the image
 is hosted with eBay Picture Services (EPS). Selecting Gallery Plus
 does not incur a separate Gallery fee.
 <br><br>
 See "Describing Items in a Listing" in the eBay Web Services
 Guide for additional information about working with pictures
 and related validation rules.
 <br><br>
 You cannot remove Gallery, Plus, or Featured when revising an item,
 however you can upgrade to a higher feature. On upgrade, the original
 feature fee is credited, and the new feature fee is charged.<br>
 <br>
 There are a number of categories on some eBay sites that always offer the Gallery
 feature for free. (The API doesn't flag these categories in any meta-data calls.) In
 these categories, if you specify a picture and you don't specify GalleryType, eBay may
 add GalleryType=Gallery to the listing (for free) and return a warning (error code
 219243). The Knowledge Base explains an edge case that could result in an unexpected
 gallery fee if the seller moves the item to a category that doesn't offer the free
 gallery feature. This fee can also appear when if the seller moves the item from a site
 that offers free Gallery (across all its categories) to one where free Gallery is not
 yet available. Whenever you change the primary category, it is a good idea to clearly
 specify whether the seller is intentionally requesting the gallery option.
 <br><br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 The following sites offer free Gallery: US (site ID 0), the Parts & Accessories
 Category on US Motors (site ID 100), CA (site ID 2), CAFR (site ID 210),
 ES (site ID 186), FR (site ID 71), IT (site ID 101),and NL (site ID 146).
 <br><br>
 On these sites, eBay will automatically create a Gallery thumbnail
 for the listing in search results by selecting a picture from one
 of the image URLs specified in the request (either
 Item.PictureDetails.PictureURL or Item.PictureDetails.GalleryURL)
 or from an available stock photo. Thus, a Gallery thumbnail
 will be created whenever Item.PictureDetails.GalleryType
 is None or is not specified in the request. A Gallery fee will
 apply whenever GalleryType specifies the Plus or Featured image enhancements
 <b>(there will be no Gallery fee whenever GalleryType is Gallery,
 None or is not specified in the request)</b>.
 <br><br>
 eBay will select the image for the thumbnail depending on which of the image URLs
 above was specified in the request (there are selection rules for four cases).
 Note that the selected image will not necessarily be the image you have
 specified in Item.PictureDetails.GalleryURL. Note that a Gallery thumbnail
 will not be automatically created if PictureURL and GalleryURL are not supplied and
 UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery and IncludeStockURL are set to false.
 <br><br>
 The most common case occurs when both GalleryURL and PictureURL are specified in the request.
 eBay will use the image referenced by PictureURL as the Gallery thumbnail.
 As three other cases exist, please refer to "Using Gallery Features
 on Sites with Free Gallery" in the eBay Web Services Guide for complete information on
 how eBay selects an image for the gallery thumbnail on these sites.
 <br><br>
 You cannot remove Gallery or Featured when revising an item,
 however you can upgrade to a higher feature. On upgrade, the original
 feature fee is credited, and the new feature fee is charged.
 (This does not apply to Gallery Plus on sites with free Gallery; see Plus below
 for more information.)

 URL for a picture to be used as the Gallery thumbnail. Ignored if
 GalleryType is None or unspecified. If the value of GalleryType is
 Gallery or Featured, you can either specify GalleryURL or allow eBay
 to use another picture that you have included in the listing.

 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 The following sites offer free Gallery: US (site ID 0), the Parts & Accessories

 <br><br>
 On these sites, eBay selects a Gallery thumbnail from image URLs included in the
 request (i.e. either GalleryURL or the first PictureURL), using selection rules that
 consider which of these URLs has been specified and whether an eBay stock photo exists
 for the item. Note that the selected gallery thumbnail may not necessarily be the one
 you specify using GalleryURL. Also, eBay selects an image regardless of whether you
 have specified either GalleryType or GalleryURL. A stock photo will not be generated
 for an item unless UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery and IncludeStockPhotoURL are set to true.
 Therefore, in this case, an item that does not have a PictureURL will not have a
 Gallery picture. A Gallery fee will only apply if you have set GalleryType to Plus or
 Featured (as basic Gallery is free). For more information on eBay's selection rules for
 the gallery thumbnail on sites with free Gallery, see "Using Gallery Features on Sites
 with Free Gallery" in the eBay Web Services Guide.</span>
 <br><br>
 (See GalleryType for the rules that determine which URL is used if you do not specify
 GalleryURL on sites where free Gallery is currently not available.) The image used for
 the Gallery thumbnail must be in one of the graphics formats JPEG, BMP, TIF, or GIF.
 See "Describing Items in a Listing" in the eBay Web Services Guide for additional
 validation rules. For eBay Live Auctions, lots are listed in the gallery for free. To
 remove GalleryURL when revising or relisting an item, use DeletedField. When you revise
 an item, you can only remove GalleryURL if the item has at least one PictureURL or a
 stock photo to use instead. If the item has bids (or items have been sold) or the
 listing ends within 12 hours, you can add GalleryURL or change its value, but you
 cannot remove the gallery URL value if it was previously specified. Not applicable to
 eBay Motors listings.

 You cannot use PhotoDisplay in combination with Listing Designer layouts.
 Specify None or do not add PhotoDisplay when ListingDesigner.LayoutID

 <br><br>
 Some PhotoDisplay options can result in listing fees, even when the item is relisted. If
 you are relisting an item that was originally listed with a PhotoDisplay option, and you
 do not want that PhotoDisplay enhancement in your relisted item, you need to specifically
 remove PhotoDisplay in your RelistItem call (or RelistFixedPriceItem, as applicable) by
 setting PhotoDisplay to None. Use VerifyRelistItem to review your listing fees before you
 relist an item.

 Contains the URL for an image associated with the item. Images can be hosted by eBay
 Picture Services (EPS) (or by eBay Picture Manager) or they can be self-hosted. Some
 options are only available if images are hosted through eBay Picture Services (EPS).
 eBay determines this by parsing the associated PictureURL value. If specified, this
 cannot have an empty/null value.
 <br><br>
 To specify multiple pictures, send each URL in a separate, adjacent PictureURL element.
 In most cases, the image at the first URL is also used for the picture at the top of
 the View Item page on the Web site.
 <br><br>
 On the main eBay site, a listing can have a maximum of 12 picture URLs hosted by eBay
 Picture Services or 1 picture URL hosted by a third-party vendor. You cannot mix
 vendor-hosted and site-hosted pictures within the same listing.
 <br><br>
 On the US eBay Motors site (for all vehicle listings), and on the eBay Canada site for
 motors, the picture pack of a listing can contain up to 24 photos.
 <br><br>
 On the eBay Live Auctions site, a listing can have a maximum of 5 picture URLs hosted
 by eBay Picture Services.
 <br><br>
 If you embed pictures in the description (by using IMG tags) instead of using
 PictureURL, but you want a camera icon to appear in search and listing pages, specify
 the following "clear image" URL in PictureURL:
 http://pics.ebay.com/aw/pics/dot_clear.gif.
 <br><br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 On sites that offer free Gallery, the camera icon will not be available to appear as a
 gallery thumbnail or in a listing page whenever the first PictureURL field in the
 request is set to the "clear image" URL. In this case, eBay will attempt to use the
 image referenced by GalleryURL as the gallery thumbnail. If GalleryURL has not been
 specified, a blank (camera-less) gallery thumbnail displays in the search results and
 at the top of the listing page. If you have set the first PictureURL to the "clear
 image" URL, you can either Item.ProductListingDetails.UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery or
 Item.ProductListingDetails.UseStockPhotoURL to true and eBay will use a stock photo, if
 available, for the gallery thumbnail as well as the picture that displays at the top of
 the listing page.
 <br><br>
 Note that a gallery picture will not be generated if UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery and
 IncludeStockPhotoURL are set to false (or not set) and no alternative picture in
 PictureURL. A Gallery fee applies only if you have specified GalleryType as either Plus
 or Featured (see Item.PictureDetails.GalleryType above for information). See "Using
 Gallery Features on Sites with Free Gallery" in the eBay Web Services Guide for
 information on eBay's selection rules for Gallery pictures on sites with free Gallery.

 <b>For VerifyAddItem only:</b> For VerifyAddItem, you can use the following
 fake eBay Picture Services URL (http://i2.ebayimg.com/abc/M28/dummy.jpg) to verify that
 your application is obtaining the correct fees for the quantity of images you pass
 in.
 <br><br>
 <b>For ReviseItem and RelistItem only:</b> To remove a picture when
 revising or relisting an item, specify PictureDetails with all the pictures that you
 want the listing to include. That is, you need to completely replace the original set
 of URLs with the revised set. To remove all PictureURL fields from a listing, specify
 item.PictureDetails.PictureURL in DeletedField. However, please note that if the
 listing also includes a gallery image that is based on the first picture in the
 listing, you may need to supply an alternate image to use as the gallery image if you
 delete all PictureURL fields.
 <br><br>
 There are a number of categories on some eBay sites that always add
 the Gallery feature (for free) when you include a picture in
 the listing and you don't specify the Gallery feature yourself.
 See GalleryType for details about fees that could be charged
 if you change the category in these cases (or when revising a listing from a
 site with free gallery to one where free gallery is not yet available.)
