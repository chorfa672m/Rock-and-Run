 The ItemRatingDetails container is for detailed seller ratings about a transaction.
 When buyers leave an overall Feedback rating (positive, neutral, or negative) for
 a seller, they also can leave ratings in four areas: item as described,
 communication, shipping time, and charges for shipping and handling. Users retrieve
 detailed ratings as averages of the ratings left by buyers.
 <br><br>
 Applicable to sites that support the Detailed Seller Ratings feature.
