 Version of the characteristics set. Not to be confused with
 AttributeSystemVersion, which can be used to retrieve changes to attribute
 meta-data. In item-listing requests, if you specify the version of the
 attribute set that you have stored locally, eBay will compare it to the
 current version on the site and return a warning if the versions do not match.
 If an error occurs due to invalid attribute data, this warning can be useful
 to help determine if you might be sending outdated data. The current value of
 version is not necessarily "greater than" the previous value.

/**
 
 A salient aspect or feature of an item. Used to describe an item in a standard
 way so that buyers can find it more easily. An individual, standardized
 characteristic that is common to all items within the specified characteristic
 set. In the context of GetProductSearchPage, each characteristic identifies a
 single searchable attribute. A searchable attribute is a product aspect or
 feature that can be used as a criterion in a search for catalog content. For
 example, "Title" might be a criterion for searching the book catalog for Pre-
 filled Item Information related to books. See the eBay Web Services guide for
 more information.
