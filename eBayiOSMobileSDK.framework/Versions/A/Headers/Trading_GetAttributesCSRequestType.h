/**
 
 Retrieves an XML string that describes how to present Item
 Specifics to a seller who is creating a new listing.
 Use this information to present users with
 the equivalent of the Item Specifics portion of the eBay Title
 and Description pages and to validate selected eBay attributes on
 the client before including them in an AddItem call or related
 calls. The XML string contains a list of all the attributes that
 are applicable for one or more requested categories, along with
 related meta-data. The meta-data specifies all the possible
 values of each attribute, the logic for presenting the attributes
 to a user, and rules for validating the user's selections. <br>
 <br>
 See the eBay Web Services Guide for an overview of Item Specifics and
 details about the eBay attribute model.<br>
 <br>
 Item Specifics are optional when listing in most categories;
 however, some categories (such as Real Estate, US Tickets, and
 US eBay Motors) require Item Specifics.

/**
 
 A version of the Item Specifics definitions (attribute meta-data)
 for the site.
 Typically, an application passes the version value that was
 returned the last time the application executed this call.
 Filter that causes the call to return only the characteristic sets
 for which the attribute meta-data has changed since the specified
 version. If not specified, all characteristics sets are returned.
 The latest version value is not necessarily greater than the
 previous value that was returned. Therefore, when comparing
 versions, only compare whether the value has changed.

/**
 
 An array of characteristic setIDs (which always correspond to
 attribute set IDs).
 Each characteristic setcorresponds to a level in the eBay
 category hierarchy at
 which all items share common characteristics.
 Multiple categories can be mapped to the same characteristic set.
 AttributeSetIDs is an optional input. When IDs are specified,
 the call only returns meta-data for the corresponding
 characteristic sets.
 When no IDs are specified, the call returns all the current
 attribute meta-data in the system.

 If true, includes a list of CategoryMapping nodes in the response.
 Each CategoryMapping node specifies category information as well as
 attributes and values that your application can auto-fill for
 items listed in that category. See the eBay Web Services Guide for more
 information about options for maintaining category data and
 auto-filling Item Specifics.
