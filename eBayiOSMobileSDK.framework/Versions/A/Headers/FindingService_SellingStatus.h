 The current price of the item given in the currency of the site on which
 the item is listed. That is, currentPrice is returned in the original
 listing currency.
 <br><br>
 For competitive-bid item listings, currentPrice is the current minimum
 bid price if the listing has no bids, or the current high bid if the
 listing has bids. A Buy It Now price has no effect on currentPrice.
 <br><br>
 For Basic Fixed-Price (FixedPrice), Store Inventory (StoreInventory), Ad
 Format (AdFormat), and Classified Ad (Classified) listings, currentPrice
 is the current fixed price.
