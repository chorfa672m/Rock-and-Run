 Returns data that indicates the categories that are mapped to characteristics sets,
 for the eBay site to which the call was routed.
 Retrieves all mappings or just the one that matches the category ID passed as input.
 The data is returned in a CategoryArrayType object, which can contain multiple mappings.
 The response also contains information about categories for which the mappings have changed.<br>

 This means the set of catalog-enabled categories is a subset of the categories
 that are mapped to characteristic sets. That is, there are no catalog-enabled categories
 that are not mapped to characteristic sets.</span>
