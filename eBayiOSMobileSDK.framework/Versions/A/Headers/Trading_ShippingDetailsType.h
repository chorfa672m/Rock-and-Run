 reduce buyer confidence in the marketplace and the practice of including buyer-

 If supplied, this container indicates the shipping rate tables that are to be applied to this listing. 
 (Currently, only the DomesticRateTable is supported.) If this container is used,
 the ShippingDetails.ShippingType must be set to Flat because only flat rate shipping can be used
 with the shipping rate tables feature. In addition, the seller must already have set up shipping rate 
 tables in the My eBay site Preferences. (You can determine this by invoking GetUser: if
 the shipping rate table is available for this seller, the SellerInfo container from GetUSer will have the
 DomesticRateTable element set to true.) This feature is currently supported for DE, UK, and US sites.
 <br><br>
 The domestic rate tables allow a seller to assign different rates and service levels to special 
 domestic locations. For example, in the US, the seller assigns a flat rate to one or more service levels
 (economy, standard, expedited, 1-day) that will apply to all of the 48 contiguous US states. The seller can
 then assign different rates and service levels to any or all of the other domestic locations:
 Alaska and Hawaii, US Protectorates, and APO/FPO. 
 <br><br>
 If the DomesticRateTable is specified in the RateTableDetails container, the rates assigned to the various
 domestic locations are used depending on the location of the buyer. If only one service level and rate has 
 been set for a given domestic location in the domestic rate table, buyers in that location will see only one 
 shipping cost.  If several service levels and rates are set up in the domestic shipping rate table for a 
 given domestic location, buyers in that location will see the different shipping levels and rates and can 
 choose one of them. (Buyers in a domestic location that does not have any service level and rate set in the 
 domestic rate table for the current seller will not be able to bid or buy items from that seller.)
 <br><br>
 A seller may wish to exclude a domestic location for a particular item even though that domestic location
 has a service level and rate set up in the domestic shipping rate table. For example, a US seller might normally
 ship to Alaska and have Alaska shipping rates set up in the domestic rate table. However, if
 an item is too heavy and the shipping costs are too expensive, a seller might 
 exclude Alaska for this item via the ShippingDetails.ExcludeShipToLocation element.
 <br><br>
 If the seller has set up shipping rate tables that contain a weight charge, you must prompt the seller
 to supply weight and specify the weight in the ShippingDetails.CalculatedShippingRate container's WeightMajor 
 and WeightMinor fields. (Even though this is flat rate.) Do not use any elements in the
 ShippingDetails.CalculatedShippingRate container other than WeightMajor and WeightMinor
 because those are not supported in this scenario. 
 <br><br>
 Remember that any value in the WeightMinor field is rounded UP to the next unit, that
 is, to the next pound or kg, when the shipping cost is calculated, so make sure you message your users 
 appropriately.  One way to do this kind of UI messaging is the way the US eBay UI does it, by presenting 
 sellers with a pulldown of weight ranges, where the pulldown lists 0 lb 
 to 1 lb as one selection (1 lb), over 1 lb to 2 lbs as another selection (2 lbs), over 2 lbs to 3 lbs as another 
 selection (3 lbs) and so on. However, your application can ask for and use specific weights (WeightMajor and WeightMinor)
 if you wish.  
 <br><br>
 Be aware that there is currently no way to determine through the API whether a seller's rate table
 uses weights, so you must do the appropriate messaging so the seller will supply the weights. If no weight is
 supplied in ShippingDetails.CalculatedShippingRate and the shipping table does require weights, a default weight of 
 one unit (one lb or one kg) is used. Currently the weights used in this scenario are not returned from GetItem or GetItemShipping, 
 although the values can be seen by the seller in the eBay UI.

 To get a list of the domestic locations, call GeteBayDetails
 with DetailName set to ShippingLocationDetails.

 This container is returned from the GetItem family of calls only for the seller who listed the item.
