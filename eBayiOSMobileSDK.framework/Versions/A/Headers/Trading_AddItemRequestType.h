/**
 
 Defines a single new item and lists it on a specified eBay site. Returns the
 item ID for the new listing, and returns fees the seller will incur for the
 listing (not including the Final Value Fee, which cannot be calculated until
 the item is sold).
 <br><br>
 Sellers who engage in cross-border trade on sites that require a recoupment agreement, must agree to the
 recoupment terms before adding items to the site. This agreement allows eBay to reimburse
 a buyer during a dispute and then recoup the cost from the seller. Links to the agreement
 will be posted to the eBay Developer Program website.
 <br><br>
 For the US, Canada (CA), French Canadian (CAFR), and US Motors sites, the FixedPriceItem listing format
 will be replacing the StoresFixedPrice listing format, and the StoresFixedPrice format will be deprecated
 in early 2011. As of March 30, 2010, we will start a migration phase where AddItem and AddFixedPriceItem
 will accept either FixedPriceItem or StoresFixedPrice as listing formats, but the item will be displayed
 as FixedPriceItem on the site and in search results. GetItem and other 'Get' calls will return the format you originally
 used in the request. Therefore, the preferred format will be FixedPriceItem.
 <br><br>
 As part of the merge of the StoresFixedPrice and FixedPriceItem formats, the start price of all new
 FixedPriceItems must be 99 cents or greater. This change will also go into effect on March 30, 2010.
