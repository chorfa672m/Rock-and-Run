/**
 
 eBay's unique identifier for a specific version of a product.
 This is the long alphanumeric ID that is returned from
 GetProductSearchResults and related calls.
 See the Trading API Guide for information about finding this type of
 product ID. (For the shorter product ID (ePID) value that is 
 displayed on the eBay Web site, see ProductReferenceID instead.)<br>
 <br>
 If the primary and secondary categories are both catalog-enabled,
 this ID should correspond to the primary category
 (not the secondary category).<br>
 <br>
 In item-listing requests, if you pass in an old product ID,
 eBay lists the item with the latest version of the product and the
 latest product ID, and the call returns a warning indicating that
 the data has changed.<br>
 <br>
 Some sites (such as eBay US, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) are updating,
 replacing, deleting, or merging some products (as a result of migrating from one
 catalog data provider to another). If you specify one of these products in a request,
 the call may return the product with a warning, or it may fail with an error if the
 product has been deleted.

 If true, indicates that the item listing includes the stock photo. To use an
 eBay stock photo in an item listing, set IncludeStockPhotoURL to true. If a
 stock photo is available, it is used at the top of the View Item page and in
 the Item Specifics section of the listing. If you also include
 Item.PictureDetails.PictureURL, the stock photo only appears in the Item
 Specifics section of the listing. Other pictures you specify by using
 Item.PictureDetails.PictureURL appear in a separate section of the listing.
 If you use Item.ExternalProductID instead of Item.ProductListingDetails, eBay
 sets IncludeStockPhotoURL to true (and you cannot set it to false). In
 GetItem, the URL of the stock photo will be returned in StockPhotoURL. If you
 set IncludeStockPhotoURL to false, the stock photo does not appear in the
 listing at all.<br>

 The following sites offer free Gallery: US (site ID 0), the Parts & Accessories

 <br><br>
 On these sites, eBay selects a Gallery thumbnail from image URLs included
 in the request (i.e. either GalleryURL or the first PictureURL), using
 selection rules that consider which of these URLs has been specified and
 whether an eBay stock photo exists for the item. Also, eBay selects an
 image regardless of whether you have specified either GalleryType or
 GalleryURL. A Gallery fee will only apply if you have set GalleryType to
 Plus or Featured (as basic Gallery is free).<br>
 <br>
 Along with these changes, IncludeStockPhotoURL will be used in the request.
 In some cases, if IncludeStockPhotoURL is set to false, no image will be
 generated for the Gallery. A common example of this occurrence is when only
 GalleryURL has been set in the request (i.e., no PictureURL elements are
 defined). In this case, eBay will not use a stock photo, even if it is
 available. See "Using Gallery Features on Sites with Free Gallery" in the
 eBay Web Services Guide for complete information.

 eBay's short global reference ID for a catalog product. 
 On the eBay Web site, this is known as the "ePID" or "Product ID". 
 This type of product ID is a fixed reference to a product 
 (regardless of version). 
 Multiple (versioned) ProductID values can be associated with a 
 single product reference ID. 
 You can find product reference IDs for products by using GetProducts 
 (or FindProducts in the Shopping API).
 You can also find the product ID on eBay's Web site 
 (a numeric value prefixed with "EPID").
 You can pass the value with or without the "EPID" prefix;
 for example "EPID228742" or "228742" (without quotes).
