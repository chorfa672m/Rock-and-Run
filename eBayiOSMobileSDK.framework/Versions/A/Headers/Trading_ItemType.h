@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *applicationData;

/**
 
 AttributeSetArray is one format that is used to to specify
 Item Specifics on the eBay Web site. (Also see Item.ItemSpecifics.)
 Item Specifics describe an item in a standard way so that buyers can
 find it more easily. For example, "Publication Year" is a standard
 property of a book.<br>
 <br>
 Contains one or more instances of AttributeSet in a list.
 For attributes in general, an item can be associated with
 no more than two full attribute sets (one for the primary category and one for the secondary category).<br>
 <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 AttributeSetArray does not support the newer
 "custom Item Specifics" model. See the ItemSpecifics node instead.<br>
 <br>
 A few sites and categories, such as US eBay Motors
 vehicle categories still require you to use AttributeSetArray
 to specify an item's condition. For most other categories, use
 the ConditionID field instead of a condition attribute.
 Use GetCategoryFeatures to see which categories support
 ConditionID and to get a list of valid condition IDs.
 Many of these categories will start requiring ConditionID starting
 in July 2010. (If you specify ConditionID and also the older
 condition attribute, eBay drops the condition attribute.) <br>
 <br>
 You should no longer use AttributeSetArray to specify
 a return policy. Use Item.ReturnPolicy instead to specify
 the seller's return policy.
 </span><br>
 <br>
 <b>For the AddItem family of calls:</b> Some categories
 (such as Event Tickets and US Real Estate) require Item Specifics.
 See the eBay Web Services Guide links below for information on
 working with Item Specifics. Use GetCategory2CS and GetAttributesCS
 to determine when attributes are required for a category.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For ReviseItem only:</b> When you revise a listing, if the
 listing has bids and ends within 12 hours, you cannot change or add
 attributes. If the listing has bids but ends in more
 than 12 hours, you cannot change existing attribute data, but you can add
 attributes that were not previously specified. The most reliable way to do this is
 to pass in the entire AttributeSetArray with all the attributes you want
 in the listing (not just the ones you want to change, because that usually
 causes the others to be removed). To delete all attributes when
 you revise or relist, specify Item.AttributeSetArray in DeletedField and don't
 pass AttributeSetArray in the request. If the original listing's attributes
 are no longer valid and you get errors when you try to revise the listing,
 you can try to pass in the entire AttributeSetArray again with corrections.
 If that doesn't work, you can end the item and relist it with a
 set of valid attributes.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetCategoryListings only:</b> For GetCategoryListings,
 AttributeSetArray can return the item condition
 (not other Item Specifics), if it was specified by using the older ID-based attribute format.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetSearchResults only:</b>
 GetSearchResults can return the item condition when the request either
 specifies IncludeCondition as true, or it specifies a
 product finder search (and a detail level of ItemReturnAttributes
 or ReturnAll). If IncludeCondition was true and the condition was
 listed in the older attribute-based format, see the ItemSpecific node for a simpler view of the condition value. <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 AttributeSetArray only returns the condition attribute's ValueID.
 For GetSearchResults, you would need to use GetAttributesCS to figure out the meaning of this ID.
 It's easier to just look at the ItemSpecific node.
 </span>
 <br>
 If SearchRequest or TicketFinder was used to perform a
 product finder search, the list of attributes is limited to
 Item Specifics that would be included in the
 summary search results on the Web site, if any.
 At this time, GetSearchResults only returns event ticket
 venue name, section, and row (if specified) for eBay US (site 0);
 and the mileage and year for eBay Motors vehicles (site 100 and
 international eBay Motors sites that support this feature).
 In other categories, no summary attributes are returned in
 search results (even when the item is
 listed with Item Specifics.) <br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetItemRecommendations only:</b>
 In GetItemRecommendations, if you use the Suggested Attributes engine,
 the engine interprets attributes you pass in as attributes that
 do NOT need recommendations (i.e., attributes that the seller has
 already filled in as desired). The engine only returns
 recommendations for attributes that you do not specify, and only for
 attributes associated with the primary category.<br>
 <br>
 For Half.com, this is only returned in GetItem. It is not applicable in
 AddItem and other requests.

/**
 
 Until April or May 2010, use this as a shortcut for specifying the
 Condition attribute by name instead of by ID.
 Only valid when listing items in
 categories that support product details (catalog-enabled
 categories).
 You can pass either AttributeSetArray or LookupAttributeArray, but
 you cannot pass both in the same request. This also means that if
 you subsequently revise the listing's attributes, you need to
 specify the condition attribute ID and value ID in AttributeSetArray
 to prevent them from being dropped from the listing. Typically used
 in combination with ProductListingDetails.<br>
 <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 Starting in April and May 2010, many categories will
 support using the ConditionID field instead.
 Use GetCategoryFeatures to see which categories support the new
 field and to get a list of valid condition IDs. In these categories,
 if you pass your item condition in LookupAttributeArray,
 eBay will not convert it to ConditionID. <br>
 <br>
 Starting in July 2010, if a category supports the new ConditionID
 field, your requests may fail if you specify the item condition in
 LookupAttributeArray.

 For Chinese auction listings, Buy It Now allows a user to purchase the item
 at a fixed price and end the auction immediately. Use this field to add Buy
 It Now and specify the amount a buyer would need to bid to take advantage of
 the Buy It Now feature.
 <br><br>
 On the main eBay site, not applicable to fixed-price items (ListingType

 listings. For fixed-price and Half.com listings, see StartPrice instead. See
 the eBay Web Services Guide for validation rules when revising US eBay
 Motors listings, including rules for lowering the Buy It Now price of a
 Motors listing.
 <br><br>
 Once a Chinese auction has bids (and the high bid exceeds the reserve price,
 if specified), the listing is no longer eligible for Buy It Now (with some
 exceptions noted below). However, calls like GetItem and GetSearchResults
 still return the BuyItNowPrice that the seller originally set for the
 listing. You can use Item.SellingStatus.BidCount to determine whether an
 auction with Buy It Now has bids or not. With GetSearchResults, you can use
 the Item.SearchDetails.BuyItNowEnabled flag to determine whether the item
 can still be purchased using Buy It Now. With GetItem, you can use the
 Item.ListingDetails.BuyItNowAvailable flag to determine whether the item can
 still be purchased using Buy It Now.
 <br><br>
 On some sites, the Buy It Now price for a Chinese auction may remain
 available for certain categories even after a bid is placed. See the "Longer
 Lasting Buy It Now" link below for more details and the latest list of eBay
 US categories that support this behavior. The eBay Spain site supports this
 behavior for all categories.
 <br><br>
 There might be price limits imposed for Buy It Now items, subject to the
 seller's PayPal account or the payment method used. Such limits cannot be
 determined via the eBay API and are not covered in eBay's API documentation
 because they can vary for each user.

 Category ID for the first (or only) category in which the item is
 listed (or will be listed, if the item is new). A number of listing
 features have dependencies on the primary category. We have pointed
 out a few of the notable dependencies below. See the descriptions
 of the fields you are using to determine whether the feature you're
 supporting depends on the listing's primary category.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>For the AddItem family of calls:</b>
 Use calls like GetCategories and GetCategoryFeatures to determine valid
 values for the site on which you are listing (see the eBay Web Services
 Guide for information on working with categories). Also see
 Item.CategoryMappingAllowed and
 Item.CategoryBasedAttributesPrefill.<br>
 <br>
 There are a number of categories on some eBay sites that always add
 the Gallery feature (for free) when you include a picture in
 the listing and you don't specify the Gallery feature yourself.
 See GalleryType for information about fees that could be charged
 if you change the category in these cases.<br>
 <br>
 Not applicable to Half.com.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For ReviseItem only:</b> When revising a listing,
 you can change the primary category only if an item
 has no bids (or no items have sold) and the listing does not end
 within 12 hours. <br>
 <br>
 If you change the listing category, any Item Specifics (attributes) that
 were previously specified may be dropped from the listing if they aren't
 valid for the new category. See Item.AttributeSetArray. For the eBay US
 site, we suggest that you avoid including a category ID when you list with an external product ID, such as ISBN. See the KB article listed below for details.<br>
 <br>
 You cannot change the meta-categories for vehicles (i.e., you cannot change
 a truck to a motorcycle), but you can change the leaf category (e.g., change
 one motorcycle subcategory to another motorcycle subcategory). See the eBay
 Web Services Guide for additional rules. International sites (such as the
 eBay Germany site) have similar rules for revising vehicle categories. <br>

 <b>For GetItemRecommendations only:</b>

 Specifies stock product information to include in a listing.
 Only applicable when listing items with product details.
 See the eBay Trading API Guide
 for information on listing with product details.<br>
 <br>
 As ProductID and ProductReferenceID are defined by eBay, they
 provide the most reliable means to identify a product.
 If you use ISBN, UPC, EAN, BrandMPN, and/or TicketListingDetails,
 eBay attempts to find a matching product on your behalf and use
 it in the listing. If no match is found, you can try using
 the catalog search calls (such as GetProductSearchResults or
 GetProducts) to find a ProductID or ProductReferenceID.<br>
 <br>
 When you specify ProductListingDetails, you must specify at
 least one product ID for the listing (ProductID,
 ProductReferenceID, ISBN, UPC, EAN, BrandMPN, and/or
 TicketListingDetails). If you specify more than one of these values
 (such as UPC and BrandMPN), eBay uses the first one
 that matches a product in eBay's catalog system. (This may be useful
 if you aren't sure which ID is more likely to result in a
 match.)<br>
 <br>
 When you specify TicketListingDetails, you must specify the
 Event Tickets category as the primary category. For other
 product ID: If you list in two categories and the primary and
 secondary categories are both catalog-enabled,
 this product should correspond to the primary
 category (not the secondary category).
 If only one category is catalog-enabled, the product listing details
 should correspond to the catalog-enabled category.
 (Use GetCategory2CS to determine which categories are
 catalog-enabled.)<br>
 <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 As a general rule, the primary category is required.
 However, if you have trouble finding a catalog-enabled
 category, you may be able to omit the primary category (except for
 event tickets). If you do, eBay will attempt to determine an
 appropriate category based on the product ID (if we find a
 matching product).
 When you specify a category that corresponds to the product
 (according to GetCategory2CS), your category is used.
 </span>
 Either Item.ExternalProductID or Item.ProductListingDetails can be
 specified in an AddItem request, but not both.
 (ExternalProductID will be deprecated in a future release.) <br>
 <br>
 <b>For ReviseItem and RelistItem only:</b> If a
 listing includes product details and you
 change a category, the rules for continuing to include product details depend on whether or not the new category is mapped to a
 characteristic set associated with the same product ID. When you revise a
 listing, if it has bids or it ends within 12 hours, you cannot change the
 product ID and you cannot remove existing product data. However, you can
 change or add preferences such as IncludeStockPhotoURL,
 UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery, and IncludePrefilledItemInformation. To delete all
 catalog data when you revise or relist an item, specify
 Item.ProductListingDetails in DeletedField and don't pass
 ProductListingDetails in the request.<br>

 This meaning of this value depends on the context.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For AddItem and related calls:</b>
 Specify the number of identical items the seller has available
 for sale in this listing. For auctions (with competitive bidding),
 Quantity must be 1. For certain other formats (e.g., fixed-price)
 the Quantity can be 1 or more. See the eBay Web site online help
 to learn which selling formats support multi-quantity sales.
 <br><br>
 <br><br>
 In multi-variation listings, this value is the sum of all the variation quantities in the listing.
 <b>For AddFixedPriceItem and VerifyAddFixedPriceItem:</b>
 Required when no variations are specified. If variations are specified, use
 Variation.Quantity for each variation instead.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For ReviseItem and ReviseFixedPriceItem:</b>
 When you revise a listing (with no variations), you can add or change this value
 only if the listing has no bids (or no items have sold) and it does not end within
 12 hours. For auction items, a change in the auction's quantity could result in a
 change in the auction type. For example, on sites that support multi-quantity
 auctions (Dutch auctions), if the quantity is changed from 1 (a Chinese auction) to
 2, the auction is now a Dutch auction. This may impose new requirements and fees on
 the seller.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For RelistItem and RelistFixedPriceItem:</b>
 Like most fields, when you use RelistItem or RelistFixedPriceItem,
 Quantity retains its original value unless you specifically change
 it. This means that the item is relisted with the value that was
 already in Quantity, not with the remaining quantity available.
 For example, if the original item's Quantity=10 and QuantitySold=3,
 eBay sets the relisted item's Quantity to 10 by default (not 7)
 when you relist the item. So, we strongly recommend that you always
 set Quantity to the correct value (your actual quantity available)
 in your relist requests.<br>
 <br>
 When eBay auto-renews a GTC listing (ListingDuration=GTC)
 on your behalf, eBay relists with correct quantity available.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetSellerEvents:</b> Quantity is returned only
 for listings where item quantity is greater than 1.
 <br><br>
 <b>For GetItem and related calls:</b>
 This is the total of the number of items available for sale plus the quantity
 already sold. To determine the number of items available, subtract
 SellingStatus.QuantitySold from this value. Even for items that supported Dutch
 auctions, where one of several items can be purchased during the auction, this
 number does not change.
 <br><br>
 <b>For transaction calls with variations:</b>
 In GetItemTransactions, Item.Quantity is the same as GetItem (the
 total quantity across all variations). In GetSellerTransactions,
 Transaction.Item.Quantity is the total quantity of the applicable
 variation (quantity available plus quantity sold).
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetDispute:</b> Quantity is
 the number of items being raised in the dispute.
 <br>
 <br>
 For SetCart input, this is only required if the parent container is submitted.
 <br><br>
 Also applicable to Half.com (valid range 1 to 1000).

 <span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong>
 As of version 619, Dutch-style (multi-item) competitive-bid auctions are deprecated.
 eBay throws an error if you submit a Dutch item listing with AddItem

 eBay generates a warning and resets the Quantity value to 1.

/**
 
 A SKU (stock keeping unit) is an identifier defined by a seller.
 Some sellers use SKUs to track complex flows of products
 and information on the client side.
 A seller can specify a SKU when listing an item with AddItem
 and related calls. eBay preserves the SKU on the item, enabling you
 to obtain it before and after a transaction is created.
 (SKU is recommended as an alternative to ApplicationData.)<br>
 <br>
 A SKU is not required to be unique. A seller can specify a
 particular SKU on one item or on multiple items.
 Different sellers can use the same SKUs.<br>
 <br>
 If the SKU is unique across a seller's active listings, and if the seller
 listed the item by using AddFixedPriceItem or RelistFixedPriceItem, the
 seller can also set Item.InventoryTrackingMethod to SKU in those calls.
 This allows the seller to use SKU instead of ItemID as a unique identifier
 in subsequent calls, such as GetItem and ReviseInventoryStatus.
 If both ItemID and SKU are specified in calls that support the use of
 SKU as a unique identifier, the ItemID value takes precedence.<br>
 <br>
 For multi-variation listings, the SKU can be used to uniquely identify a variation that is being revised or relisted.
 If InventoryTrackingMethod is ItemID, an ItemID is also required.
 When both SKU and VariationSpecifics are passed in the request, the variation specifics take precedence as the unique identifier. <br>
 <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 The eBay Web site UI cannot identify listings by SKU. For example,
 My eBay pages and Search pages all identify listings by item ID.
 When a buyer contacts you via eBay's messaging functionality, eBay
 uses the item ID as the identifier. Buyer-focused APIs (like the
 Shopping API) also do not support SKU as an identifier.
 </span>
 <b>For revising and relisting only:</b>
 To remove a SKU when you revise or relist an item, use DeletedField.

 <b>For AddItem and VerifyAddItem only:</b>
 On the US site, if you are listing in a media category, eBay determines the primary

 There may be cases when the category ID can't be determined and you

 GroupCategoryID is returned if there is a value of

 call. However, the results depend on the items and groups
 requested.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Best Match algorithm will try to evenly fit the items and
 return groups of 'Best Matching' Categories. A 'category group' can
 be a parent category that contains the best-matching items from
 several of its subcategories. Within each category group, items
 will be also sorted by best match. The only condition when you may
 not get a GroupCategoryID returned at all is when the request is
 for one group and there is more than one category that has matching
 items. Very rarely, the same item will appear once in the group for
 its primary category and once in another group for its secondary
 category, in the same result set. Also very occasionally, a Store
 Inventory Item can appear in the results before a regular listing.

 Describes the seller's return policy. Most categories on most
 eBay sites require the seller to clearly specify whether or not
 returns are accepted (see ReturnsAcceptedOption). <br>
 <br>
 <b>For the AddItem family of calls:</b> Required for
 most categories on most sites. Use ReturnPolicyEnabled
 in GetCategoryFeatures to determine which categories require this
 field. Also use ReturnPolicyDetails in GeteBayDetails to determine
 which ReturnPolicy fields can be used on each site.<br>
 <br>
 eBay India (IN), Australia (AU), and US eBay Motors
 Parts and Accessories categories typically support but do not
 require a return policy. (However, we strongly recommend that
 you specify a clear return policy whenever possible.)<br>
 <br>
 <b>For ReviseItem only:</b> If the listing has bids or
 sales and it ends within 12 hours, you can't change the return policy
 details. If the listing is a GTC listing that has sales or ends within 12
 hours (one or the other, but not both), you can add a return policy to the
 GTC listing (but you can't change return policy details if already present).
 If the listing has no bids or sales and more than 12 hours remain before the
 listing ends, you can add or change the return policy. When you revise your
 return policy, you only need to specify the fields you want to add or
 change. You don't need to specify all the other ReturnPolicy fields again.
 The other fields will retain their existing settings.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For the GetItem family of calls:</b> Only returned if the

 Variations are multiple similar (but not identical) items in a
 single fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing
 could contain multiple items of the same brand
 that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and
 "Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of
 these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different
 quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one
 variation at the same time. (That is, one transaction can contain
 multiple items from a single variation.) <br>
 <br>
 If you list in two categories, both categories must support 
 listing with variations. See VariationsEnabled in 
 GetCategoryFeatures to determine applicable categories.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For ReviseFixedPriceItem and
 RelistFixedPriceItem:</b> Once a listing has been submitted with variations,
 you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because
 it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation
 specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace
 individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has
 no transactions, use the Variation.Delete field to delete the variation. If it has
 inventory, set the Quantity to 0.<br>
 <br>
 As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in
 the same listing at the same time (i.e, within a very short period),
 use a single ReviseFixedPriceItem request and include all the
 variation revisions in the same request. If your application design
 requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using
 multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous
 process. That is, wait until each revision has been
 processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for
 another variation in the same listing.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetItem and related calls</b> Only returned
 when a listing has variations.
 <br><br>
 <b>For GetSellerList:</b> Only returned when a listing
 has variations, IncludeVariations was set to true in the request,
 the DetailLevel was set to ReturnAll, and an applicable pagination
 value and time range were specified.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetItemTransactions</b> Only returned in Item
 when a listing has variations and IncludeVariations was set to true
 in the request. (Also see Variation returned in Transaction for
 information about which variation was actually purchased.)
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetSellerEvents</b> Only returned
 when a listing has variations and HideVariations was set to false
 or not specified in the request.

 A list of parts compatibility information specified as name and value pairs.
 Describes an assembly with which a part is compatible (i.e., compatibility by
 application). For example, to specify a part's compatibility with a vehicle,
 the name (search name) would map to standard vehicle characteristics (e.g.,
 Year, Make, Model, Trim, and Engine). The values would desribe the specific
 vehicle, such as a 2006 Honda Accord. Use the Product Metadata API to
 retrieve valid search names and corresponding values.
 <br><br>
 <b>For the AddItem family of calls:</b> Use this for specifying
 parts compatibility by application manually. This can only be used in
 categories that support parts compatibility by application. Use <b
 class="con">GetCategoryFeatures</b> with the "CompatibilityEnabled"
 feature ID to determine which categories support parts compatibility by
 application.
 <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 Starting with release 687, invalid item compatibility combinations will not cause the request to fail as long as <b class="con">ItemCompatibilityList</b> contains at least one valid item compatibility. Only valid compatibilities will be added to the listing. Any invalid compatibility combinations will be reported in the long error message in the response errors with a severity of Warning. 
 </span>
 <br>
 <br><br>
 <b>For ReviseFixedPriceItem and ReviseItem:</b> When you revise a
 listing, if the listing has bids and/or ends within 12 hours, item
 compatibilities cannot be deleted. You may add item compatibilities at any
 time.
 <br><br>
 <b>For GetItem:</b> <b

 seller included item compatibility in the listing and <b
 class="con">IncludeItemCompatibilityList</b> is set to true in the
 <b class="con">GetItem</b> request.

 The numeric ID (e.g., 1000) for the item condition. 
 Sellers should also clarify the item's  condition in their 
 own item description.<br>
 <br>
 <b>For the AddItem family of calls:</b>
 Use GetCategoryFeatures for details about which categories support
 (or require) ConditionID, plus policies and help on choosing the
 right condition for the item (to reduce disputes). <br>
 <br>
 Please note the following behavior if you pass a ConditionID value
 that is not valid for the category: If ConditionID is disabled
 (or not applicable) for the category, the item is listed with no
 condition. If ConditionID is enabled or required for the category, the listing request fails.<br>
 <br>
 If you are listing in two categories, the primary category determines which condition model (ConditionID or item specifics) and which condition values can be used. <br>
 <br>
 Some categories may support ConditionID but also define conditions
 in GetAttributesCS or GetCategorySpecifics. Even if a category still
 seems to support passing item condition in AttributeSetArray,
 LookupAttributeArray, or ItemSpecifics fields, you should use
 ConditionID instead.<br>
 <br>
 US eBay Motors vehicle categories will support ConditionID in a
 future release. Use AttributeSetArray to specify a vehicle's
 item condition instead. Keep an eye on the eBay Developers Program
 newsletter for updates.<br>
 <br>
 Not applicable to Half.com in listing requests (e.g., AddItem).
 However, ConditionID could be returned in responses for
 Half.com listings that are available to or sold on the
 eBay site (as appropriate for the corresponding eBay category).<br>
 <br>
 <b>For Revise/Relist calls:</b> In most cases, you can add or modify ConditionID when you revise or relist.
 If GetCategoryFeatures returns ConditionEnabled=Required for the
 listing's category, you cannot remove ConditionID from the listing.<br>
 <br>
 If an auction has bids or ends within 12 hours, you cannot remove or
 change its condition, and you cannot replace a condition
 attribute or custom item specific with ConditionID. In this case,
 you will still be able to modify other fields that are normally
 editable, even if ConditionID is not present.<br>
 <br>
 In most cases, you can add or modify ConditionID for multi-quantity
 fixed price listings. (If a multi-quantity fixed price listing has
 revision restrictions imposed by other choices the seller has made
 in the listing, you might not be able to remove or change the
 condition.)<br>
 <br>
 If you revise or relist a GTC listing that only has a condition
 attribute or custom item specific, you need to specify ConditionID 
 (if the category requires it). ReviseInventoryStatus also fails 
 if you attempt to revise listings that are missing ConditionID.
 (This rule does not apply during auto-renewal of a GTC listing.
 It only applies when you perform an action on the listing.) <br>
 <br>
 <b>For GetItem:</b> Only returned when the seller
 specified ConditionID in their listing. GetItem also returns
 a localized display name.<br>
 <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 For most categories, eBay does not convert item condition data in 
 the older AttributeSetArray, LookupAttributeArray, or ItemSpecifics
 format to this format in older listings or when you revise or 
 relist items.
 This means GTC listings and older ended or sold listings
 may still return the item condition in these other fields even after
 new listings only support ConditionID.<br>
 <br>
 There are a few categories in which automatic mapping does occur, 
 where the old and newer conditions are identical. See the "Automatic Mapping" tab in the Item Condition Look-up Table link below for details.<br>
 <br>
 Also, if you specified ConditionID but the category also supports
 condition in item specifics, you may receive a
 "Dropped condition from Item specifics" warning.
 You can ignore this warning as long as you used ConditionID.

 For example, condition ID 1000 could be called
