 Whether the seller will accept a best offer for this item.
 This feature enables a buyer to make a lower-priced binding offer on a
 fixed price item. Buyers can't see how many offers have been made
 (only the seller can see this information). To make a best offer on a
 listing, use the eBay Web site.

/**
 
 The Buy It Now price of the item, returned in the currency of the site
 on which the item was listed.
 <br />
 <br />
 For Chinese auctions (competitive bidding online auctions),
 Buy It Now lets a user purchase the item at a fixed price and
 end the auction immediately. On most sites, after a Chinese
 auction has bids, the listing is no longer eligible for Buy It Now.
 However, calls can return BuyItNowPrice if
 the seller originally listed the item with a Buy It Now option.
 Use the Item.BidCount field to determine whether an auction with
 Buy It Now has bids or not, and use Item.BuyItNowAvailable to see
 if the Buy It Now option is still available.
 <br />
 <br />
 Price fields are returned as doubles, not necessarily in the traditional
 monetary format of the site's country. For example, a US Dollar value might be
 returned as 3.880001 instead of 3.88.

 <br />
 For fixed-price (FixedPriceItem) and Store Inventory listings

 In finding calls (like FindItemsAdvanced), this value concatenates several
 Item Specifics: The Make (e.g., "Buick"), Model (e.g., Skylark), Submodel

 <br>
 <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 GetSingleItem and FindItemsAdvanced do not return the same Item.Title
 value for US eBay Motors listings. Here's why:
 <br>
 <br>
 In general, GetSingleItem maps to eBay's View Item page. The eBay Motors
 Web site's View Item page shows two vehicle titles in the title bar: One
 title is a label based on the Year, Make, Model, and Submodel (e.g.,
 "1996 Buick Skylark Limited"). The model is included unless it's "Other"
 or unspecified. The submodel is included if the seller specified a
 submodel. The other title is a path based on the Make and Model (e.g.,
 "Buick : Skylark"). The Item.Title value in GetSingleItem maps to this
 path.
 <br>
 <br>
 In general, FindItemsAdvanced maps to eBay's advanced search functionality. The
 Item.Title value described above for FindItemsAdvanced maps to the item's search
 result title in the eBay Motors search results page.

 Category-specific fields that the seller added to describe
 the listing. The names of these fields are different for items
 in different categories, so they're returned in a generic

 <br>
 <br>
 For example, a book's item specifics might include a field like
 Publication Year=2007 (where Publication Year is returned in Name, and
 2007 is returned in Value), and a field like Format=Hardcover. But a car's
 item specifics would be different from a book's, with fields like Make=
 Toyota and Model=Prius. And a ticket's item specifics would be different
 from those of books and cars, with fields like EventType=Concerts and
 Venue=The Fillmore.
 <br>
 <br>
 One of the most common uses for item specifics is the item condition.
 <br>
 <br>
 Only returned if the seller included Item Specifics in the listing.<br>
 <br>
 <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 Starting in May 2010, many categories in Production and Sandbox

 ConditionDisplayName instead, if the seller used ConditionID
 instead of ItemSpecifics.

 If true, the seller requires immediate payment for the item. If false (or

 A seller can choose to require immediate payment for Fixed Price and Buy
 It Now listings, including eBay Stores Inventory listings. If a Buy It
 Now item ends as an auction (that is, if the Buy It Now option is removed
 due to bids being placed on the listing), the immediate payment
 requirement does not apply.

 A lot is a set of two or more similar items that must be purchased together in
 a single transaction. A listing can have multiple lots (instead of multiple
 items). When LotSize is specified, the listing price reflects the price of
 each lot (not each item within the lot). In this case, Quantity indicates the
 number of lots being listed, and LotSize indicates the number of items in each
 lot. (If a listing has no lots, Quantity indicates the number of separate
 items being listed.) Important: Lot items can be listed only in lot-enabled
 categories. GetCategories returns lot size disabled with a value of true
 for categories that do not support lots.

 Most categories use the same display name for the

 For example, condition ID 1000 could be called
