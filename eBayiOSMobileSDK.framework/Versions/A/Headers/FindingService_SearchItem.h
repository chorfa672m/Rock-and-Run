/**
 
 The URL to view this specific listing on eBay.
 <br><br>
 The returned URL is optimized to support natural search. That is, the URL
 is designed to make items on eBay easier to find via popular internet
 search engines. The URL includes the item title along with other
 optimizations. To note, "?" (question mark) optimizes to "_W0QQ", "&"
 (ampersand) optimizes to "QQ", and "=" (equals sign) optimizes to "Z".
 <br><br>
 Do not modify the returned URLs in your application queries (for example,
 eBay won't recognize the URL if you change QQ to &). In the Sandbox
 environment (and on the Hong Kong site), the data returned in this field
 is a standard ViewItem URL rather than the ViewItemURL for natural
 search.
 <br><br>
 If you enabled affiliate tracking in the call, viewItemURL contains a 
 string that includes affiliate tracking information.

 <span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong>
 eBay URLs returned in fields, such as <b 
 class="con">viewItemURL</b>, are subject to syntax and other
 changes without notice. To avoid problems in your application when eBay
 alters the URL format, we advise you to avoid parsing eBay URLs
 programmatically. We strive to ensure that other fields in the response
 contain all the information that is encoded in the URL, and more.

 A seller can choose to require immediate payment for Fixed Price and Buy
 It Now listings, including eBay Stores Inventory listings. If a Buy It
 Now item ends as an auction (that is, if the Buy It Now option is removed
 due to bids being placed on the listing), the immediate payment
 requirement does not apply.

 flag does not change.

 Starting in March 2010, parts compatibility will be supported in limited
 Parts & Accessories categories for eBay Motors in the Production
 environment. For these categories, a compatible application will always
 be a vehicle, which is specified by a combination of make, model, and
 year. Optionally, trim and engine data may also be specifed for a
 vehicle.
 <br><br>
 This field returns terms from the keywords in the request that match
 values in one of the item's compatible applications (vehicles). If the
 keywords match more than one compatible application for an item, the
 field returns "Two or more of your vehicles" to indicate multiple
 matches.
 <br><br>
 For example, keyword queries that contain vehicle details, such as make
 and model (e.g., Honda Accord), in addition to keywords for the part or
 accessory, will search through structured parts compatibility information
 for matching listings. If an item has a 2007 Honda Accord (any trim or
 engine) specified as a compatible application, and the item matches the
 part or accessory terms in the query, this field will return the matching
 terms from the query (i.e., Honda Accord).
 <br><br>
 Parts compatibility is an eBay feature that uses structured data to
 associate compatible assemblies with parts and accessories listed on
 eBay. For example, parts compatibility enables sellers to specify
 accurately and comprehensively the vehicles on which a side mirror or a
 rim fit. Parts compatibility improves search relevancy and frees up item
 titles and descriptions for more useful descriptions of the part.

 The distance that the item is from the buyer, calculated using
 buyerPostalCode. The unit for distance varies by site, and is either

 kilometers to measure distance (for example, India/EBAY-IN), the unit is
 kilometers. If the site is either the US or UK, the distance unit is
 miles.
 <br><br>
 This value is only returned for distance-based searches. You must specify
 a buyerPostalCode and either sort by Distance, or use a combination of
 the MaxDistance LocalSearch itemFilters.
