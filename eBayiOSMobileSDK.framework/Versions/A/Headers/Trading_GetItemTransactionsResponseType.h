/**
 
 Returns an array of transaction data for the item specified in the request.
 The results can be used to create a report of data that is commonly
 necessary for end-of-auction processing.
 Zero, one, or many Transaction objects can be returned in the array.
 The set of transactions returned is limited to those that were modified between
 the times specified in the request's ModTimeFrom and ModTime filters.
 Also returns the item object that spawned the transactions.
 If pagination filters were specified in the request, returns meta-data describing
 the effects of those filters on the current response and the estimated effects if
 the same filters are used in subsequent calls.
 <br><br>
 Data from the transaction array may be used to trigger the following Platform
 Notifications: EndOfAuction, AuctionCheckoutComplete, FixedPriceEndOfTransaction,
 CheckoutBuyerRequestTotal, FixedPriceTransaction, Checkout,
 FixedPriceTransactionForSeller, FixedPriceTransactionForBuyer, ItemMarkedAsShipped,
 and ItemMarkedAsPaid. Each notification will be based on the state of the item
 (a 'snapshot' of the item) at the time the transaction was created.
