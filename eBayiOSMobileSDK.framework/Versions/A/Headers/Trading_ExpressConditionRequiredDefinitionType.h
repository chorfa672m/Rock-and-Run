/**
  
 For the US and Germany sites, an eBay item must meet a number of eligibility
 requirements in order to also be included on eBay Express. One requirement is that
 the item must include the Item Condition attribute (using Item Specifics). Some
 categories may waive this requirement. Currently, this type defines no special
 meta-data. (An empty element is returned.)
