 <br><br>
 Only feedback left by verified users can count toward the aggregate score of
 another user. If a user is not verified and leaves a feedback, then later becomes verified,
 that feedback will still not be counted. Or, if a user is verified and at some
 later date changes to unverified status, the feedback left while the user was
 verified remains countable. So you cannot determine a user's current
 verification status from whether or not feedback they've left is or was
 countable. Whether or not feedback is countable has nothing to do with the
 verification status of the one receiving the comment, only the one leaving
 the feedback.
