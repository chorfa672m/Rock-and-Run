 If you are using SetNotificationPreferences, you can use the PayloadVersion
 field to specify the API version for all notifications for the calling
 application. If you are using GetNotificationPreferences, this field contains
 the API version for all notifications for the calling application. If you do
 not specify PayloadVersion in SetNotificationPreferences, the behavior of
 notifications is the same as it was before the PayloadVersion field was added
 to the schema. Before the PayloadVersion field was added to the schema, the
 API version for notifications was based on the API version specified as part
 of your SetNotificationPreferences call. Now, you can use PayloadVersion to
 override the API version specified as part of your SetNotificationPreferences
 call.

/**
 
 Defines settings for a notification URL (including the URL name in DeliveryURLName).
 You define settings for a notification URL (including the URL name in DeliveryURLName) in the
 DeliveryURLDetails container. You associate a user token with a notification URL by using the token
 in a SetNotificationPreferences request that specifies the URL name in
 SetNotificationPreferencesRequest.DeliveryURLName.
 If you associate a single user token to multiple URL names, each URL name overwrites
 the previous name associated with the token. You can specify up to 10 notification URLs for an application.
 Note that Notifications will not be sent to any URL(s) if
 ApplicationDeliveryPreferencesType.ApplicationEnable is set to Disable.
