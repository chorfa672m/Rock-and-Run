 assembly with which a part is compatible (i.e., compatibility by application). For
 example, to specify a part's compatibility with a vehicle, the name would map to
 standard vehicle characteristics (e.g., Year, Make, Model, Trim, and Engine). The
 values would desribe the specific vehicle, such as a 2006 Honda Accord.
