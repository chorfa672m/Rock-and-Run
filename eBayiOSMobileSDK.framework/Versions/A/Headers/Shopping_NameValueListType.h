 This field is returned only in responses if the seller included an item specific
 Name in the listing. However, if the seller didn't also include a corresponding
 value for the item specific, it is best to not display the name to name to avoid
 confusing users.

 For the item condition, this usually includes the word "Condition" for eBay US,
 UK, Australia, and India listings; and "Artikelzustand" for eBay Germany, Austria,
 and Switzerland listings.

 this field may return empty, or it may return a value like "-",
 "Not Selected", or "Unspecified" (or the equivalent in the language
 of the site).
