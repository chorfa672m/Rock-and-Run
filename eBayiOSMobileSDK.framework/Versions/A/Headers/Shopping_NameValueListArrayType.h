/**
 
 This list is an array of Item Specifics, which are category-specific 
 fields that the seller added to describe the listing. The names of 
 these fields are different for items in different categories, so 
 they're returned in a generic name/value structure.
 <br><br>
 For example, Item Specifics for a car might include a field like
 Make=Toyota (where Make is returned in Name, and Toyota is returned 
 in Value) and Model=Prius (where Model is returned in Name, and 
 Prius is returned in Value).<br>
 <br>
 In multi-variation listings, the same name cannot appear in both
 the VariationSpecifics node and in the ItemSpecifics node.
 <br><br>
 For FindProducts, this can also be an Item Specific that is defined 
 for a product. That is, Item Specifics can be returned both for
 items and products in FindProducts.
